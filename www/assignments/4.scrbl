@bold{Due: Wednesday, November 1, 11:59PM EST}

The goal of this assignment is to extend a compiler with binding
forms and primitives that can take any number of arguments.

You are given a @tt{fraud-plus.zip} file on ELMS with a starter
compiler similar to the @seclink["Fraud"]{Fraud} language we studied
in class.  You are tasked with:

@itemlist[

@item{incorporating the language features you added in
@seclink["Assignment 3"]{Assignment 3}, scaled up to Fraud,}

@item{extending the addition primitive to handle an arbitrary number of arguments,}

@item{extending the @racket[let]-binding form of the language to bind any number of variables, and}

@item{adding a @racket[let*]-binding form to the language to allow back-references.}
]

@section[#:tag-prefix "a4-" #:style 'unnumbered]{From Dupe+ to Fraud+}

Implement the @racket[abs], unary @racket[-], and @racket[not]
operations and the @racket[cond] and @racket[case] forms from
@seclink["Assignment 3"]{Assignment 3}.

Unlike Assignment 3, the AST struct definitions and parsing code are
provided. Study the relevant parts in @tt{ast.rkt} and @tt{parse.rkt},
understand what is different (if anything) from your own
implementation and implement the relevant functionality in
@tt{interp.rkt}, @tt{interp-prim.rkt}, and @tt{compile.rkt}.  You can
start from your previous code, but you will need to update it to work
for the structures provided. What's essentially left for you to do is
to make sure to correctly signal an error (@racket['err]) when these
constructs are applied to the wrong type of argument.

While you're at it, implement the predicates @racket[integer?] and
@racket[boolean?] for checking the type of an argument, modeled by
@racket[char?] which was covered in the lectures.


The following files have already been updated for you:
@itemlist[
@item{@tt{ast.rkt}}
@item{@tt{parse.rkt}} 
]

You will need to modify:
@itemlist[
@item{@tt{compile.rkt}}
@item{@tt{interp.rkt}}
@item{@tt{interp-prim.rkt}}
]
to correctly implement these features.

You do not necessarily need to change all of these files depending on
your design choices, but you shouldn't alter any other files for
Gradescope to work.

@section[#:tag-prefix "a4-" #:style 'unnumbered]{From Binary to Variadic Addition}

In Fraud, we implemented a binary operation for addition. However,
Racket supports an arbitrary number of arguments for @racket[+]. Your
job is to extend the interpreter and compiler to behave similarly.

The following file have already been updated for you:

@itemlist[
@item{@tt{ast.rkt}}
@item{@tt{parse.rkt}}
]

You will need to modify
@itemlist[
@item{@tt{compile.rkt}}
@item{@tt{interp.rkt}}
@item{@tt{interp-prim.rkt}}
]
to correctly implement these features. 

@section[#:tag-prefix "a4-" #:style 'unnumbered]{Generalizing Let}

The Fraud language has a let form that binds a single variable in the
scope of some expression.  This is a restriction of the more general
form of @racket[let] that binds any number of expressions.  So for
example,

@racketblock[
(let ((x 1) (y 2) (z 3))
  _e)
]

simultaneously binds @racket[x], @racket[y], and @racket[z] in the
scope of @racket[_e].

The syntax of a @racket[let] expression allows any number of binders
to occur, so @racket[(let () _e)] is valid syntax and is equivalent to
@racket[_e].

The binding of each variable is only in scope in the body, @bold{not}
in the right-hand-sides of any of the @racket[let].

For example, @racketblock[(let ((x 1) (y x)) 0)] is a syntax error
because the occurrence of @racket[x] is not bound.

The following file have already been updated for you:

@itemlist[
@item{@tt{ast.rkt}}
@item{@tt{parse.rkt}}
]

You will need to modify
@itemlist[
@item{@tt{compile.rkt}}
@item{@tt{interp.rkt}}
]
to correctly implement the generalized form of @racket[let].

@section[#:tag-prefix "a4-" #:style 'unnumbered]{Back-Referencing Let}

Similar to @racket[let] there is also @racket[let*] that also binds any number
of expressions. The difference is that previous bindings are available to
subsequent bindings. For example,

@racketblock[
(let* ((x 1) (y 2) (z (add1 y)))
  _e)
]

binds @racket[x] to 1, @racket[y] to 2, and @racket[z] to 3 in
the scope of @racket[_e].

The syntax of a @racket[let*] expression allows any number of binders
to occur, so @racket[(let* () _e)] is valid syntax and is equivalent to
@racket[_e].

Unlike @racket[let], @racketblock[(let* ((x 1) (y x)) 0)] is @emph{not} a syntax
error.

The following file have already been updated for you:

@itemlist[
@item{@tt{ast.rkt}}
@item{@tt{parse.rkt}}
]

You will need to modify
@itemlist[
@item{@tt{compile.rkt}}
@item{@tt{interp.rkt}}
]
to correctly implement the generalized form of @racket[let*].

HINT: what would a lazy compiler writer do?

@section[#:tag-prefix "a4-" #:style 'unnumbered]{Testing}

You can test your code in several ways:

@itemlist[

 @item{Using the command line @tt{raco test .} from
  the directory containing the repository to test everything.}

 @item{Using the command line @tt{raco test <file>} to
  test only @tt{<file>}.}
]

Note that only a small number of tests are given to you, so you should
write additional test cases.

@section[#:tag-prefix "a4-" #:style 'unnumbered]{Submitting}

Submit a zip file containing your work to Gradescope.  Use @tt{make
submit.zip} from within the @tt{fraud-plus} directory to create a zip
file with the proper structure.

We will only use the @tt{compile.rkt}, @tt{interp.rkt}, and
@tt{interp-prim.rkt} files for grading, so make sure all your work is
contained there! Note the lack of @tt{ast.rkt}, @tt{parse.rkt}, etc. -
part of assignment 3 was learning to design your own structures, part
of assignment 4 is learning to work within the constraints of an
existing design!
