@title[#:tag "Assignment 3" #:style 'unnumbered]{Assignment 3: Primitives, conditionals}

@(require (for-label a86/ast (except-in racket ...)))

@bold{Due: @assign-deadline[3]}

The goal of this assignment is to extend the language developed in
@secref{Dupe} with some simple unary numeric and boolean operations
and two forms of control flow expressions: @racket[cond]-expressions
and @racket[case]-expressions.

@section[#:tag-prefix "a3-" #:style 'unnumbered]{Dupe+}

The Dupe+ language extends Dupe in the follow ways:

@itemlist[
@item{adding new primitive operations,}
@item{adding @racket[cond], and}
@item{adding @racket[case].}
]

@subsection[#:tag-prefix "a3-" #:style 'unnumbered]{Primitives}

The following new primitves are included in Dupe+:

@itemlist[
@item{@racket[(abs _e)]: compute the absolute value of @racket[_e],}
@item{@racket[(- _e)]: flips the sign of @racket[_e], i.e. compute @math{0-@racket[_e]}, and}
@item{@racket[(not _e)]: compute the logical negation of @racket[_e]; note that the negation of @emph{any} value other than @racket[#f] is @racket[#f] and the negation of @racket[#f] is @racket[#t].}
]

@subsection[#:tag-prefix "a3-" #:style 'unnumbered]{Conditional expressions}

The following new conditional form is included in Dupe+:

@racketblock[
(cond [_e-p1 _e-a1]
      ...
      [else _e-an])
]

A @racket[cond] expression has any number of clauses @racket[[_e-pi
_e-ai] ...], followed by an ``else'' clause @racket[[else _en]].  For
the purposes of this assignment, we will assume every @racket[cond]
expression ends in an @racket[else] clause, even though this is not
true in general for Racket.  The parser should reject any
@racket[cond]-expression that does not end in @racket[else].


The meaning of a @racket[cond] expression is computed by evaluating
each expression @racket[_e-pi] in order until the first one that
does not evaluate to @racket[#f] is found, in which case, the corresponding expression
@racket[_e-ai] is evaluated and its value is the value of the
@racket[cond] expression.  If no such @racket[_e-pi] exists, the
expression @racket[_e-an]'s value is the value of the @racket[cond].

@subsection[#:tag-prefix "a3-" #:style 'unnumbered]{Case expressions}

The following new case form is included in Dupe+:

@racketblock[
(case _ev
      [(_d1 ...) _e1]
      ...
      [else _en])
]

The @racket[case] expression form is a mechanism for dispatching
between a number of possible expressions based on a value, much like
C's notion of a @tt{switch}-statement.

The meaning of a @racket[case] expression is computed by evaluating
the expression @racket[_ev] and then proceeding in order through each
clause until one is found that has a datum @racket[_di] equal to
@racket[_ev]'s value.  Once such a clause is found, the corresponding
expression @racket[_ei] is evaluated and its value is the value of the
@racket[case] expression.  If no such clause exists, expression
@racket[_en] is evaluated and its value is the value of the
@racket[case] expression.

Note that each clause consists of a parenthesized list of
@emph{datums}, which in the setting of Dupe means either integer or
boolean literals.

@section[#:tag-prefix "a3-" #:style 'unnumbered]{Implementing Dupe+}

You must extend the parser, interpreter, and compiler to implement
Dupe+.  You are given a file @tt{dupe-plus.zip} on ELMS with a starter
compiler based on the @secref{Dupe} language we studied in class.

You may use any a86 instructions you'd like, however it is possible to
complete the assignment using @racket[Cmp], @racket[Je], @racket[Jg],
@racket[Jmp], @racket[Label], @racket[Mov], and @racket[Sub].

@subsection[#:tag-prefix "a3-" #:style 'unnumbered]{Implementing primitives}

Implement the primitives as described earlier.

There are many ways to implement these at the assembly level. You should try implementing
these using the limited a86 instruction set.

To do this, you should:
@itemlist[
@item{Study @tt{ast.rkt} and the new forms of expression (i.e. new AST nodes)
      then update the comment at the top describing what the grammmar should look like.}
      
@item{Study @tt{parse.rkt} and add support for parsing these
expressions. (See @secref[#:tag-prefixes '("a3-")]{parse} for guidance.)}

@item{Update @tt{interp-prim.rkt} and @tt{interp.rkt} to correctly interpret these expressions.}

@item{Make examples of these primitives and potential translations of them
to assembly.}

@item{Update @tt{compile.rkt} to correctly compile these expressions.}

@item{Check your implementation by running the tests in @tt{test/all.rkt}.}
]

@section[#:tag-prefix "a3-" #:style 'unnumbered]{Implementing cond}

Implement the @racket[cond] expression form as described earlier.
To do this, you should:

@itemlist[
@item{Study @tt{ast.rkt} to add appropriate AST nodes.}
@item{Extend @tt{parse.rkt} to parse such expressions. (See @secref[#:tag-prefixes '("a3-")]{parse} for guidance.)}
@item{Update @tt{interp-prim.rkt} and @tt{interp.rkt} to correctly interpret @racket[cond] expressions.}

@item{Make examples of @racket[cond]-expressions and potential translations of them
to assembly.}

@item{Update @tt{compile.rkt} to correctly compile @racket[cond]
expressions based on your examples.}

@item{Check your implementation by running the tests in @tt{test/all.rkt}.}
]

@section[#:tag-prefix "a3-" #:style 'unnumbered]{Implementing case}

Implement the @racket[case] expression form as described earlier.
To do this, you should:

@itemlist[
@item{Study @tt{ast.rkt} to add appropriate AST nodes.}
@item{Extend @tt{parse.rkt} to parse such expressions. (See @secref[#:tag-prefixes '("a3-")]{parse} for guidance.)}
@item{Update @tt{interp-prim.rkt} and @tt{interp.rkt} to correctly interpret @racket[case] expressions.}

@item{Make examples of @racket[case]-expressions and potential translations of them
to assembly.}

@item{Update @tt{compile.rkt} to correctly compile @racket[case] expressions based on your examples.}

@item{Check your implementation by running the tests in @tt{test/all.rkt}.}
]

@section[#:tag-prefix "a3-" #:style 'unnumbered #:tag "parse"]{A Leg Up on Parsing}

In the past, designing the AST type and structure definitions has
given students some grief.  Getting stuck at this point means you
can't make any progress on the assignment and making a mistake at this
level can cause real trouble down the line for your compiler.

For that reason, let us give you a strong hint for a potential design
of the ASTs and examples of how parsing could work.  You are not
required to follow this design, but you certainly may.

Here's a potential AST definition for the added primitives,
@racket[cond], and @racket[case]:

@#reader scribble/comment-reader
(racketblock
;; type Expr =
;; ...
;; | (Cond [Listof CondClause] Expr)
;; | (Case Expr [Listof CaseClause] Expr)

;; type CondClause = (Clause Expr Expr)
;; type CaseClause = (Clause [Listof Datum] Expr)

;; type Datum = Integer | Boolean

;; type Op = 
;; ...
;; | 'abs | '- | 'not

(struct Cond (cs e)    #:prefab)
(struct Case (e cs el) #:prefab)
(struct Clause (p b)   #:prefab)
)

There are two new kinds of expression constructors: @racket[Cond] and
@racket[Case].  A @racket[Cond] AST node contains a list of
cond-clauses and expression, which the expression of the @racket[else]
clause.  Each cond-clause is represented by a @racket[Clause]
structure containing two expressions: the left-hand-side of the
clause which is used to determine whether the right-hand-side is
evaluated, and the right-hand-side expression.

The @racket[Case] AST node contains three things: an expression that
is the subject of the dispatch (i.e. the expression that is evaluated
to determine which clause should be taken), a list of case-clauses
(not to be confused with cond-clauses), and an @racket[else]-clause
expression.  Each case-clause, like a cond-clause, consists of two
things.  Hence we re-use the @racket[Clause] structure, but with
different types of elements.  The first element is a list of
@emph{datums}, each being either an integer or a boolean.

Now, we won't go so far as to @emph{give} you the code for
@racket[parse], but we can give you some examples:

@itemlist[

@item{@racket[(abs 1)] parses as @racket[(Prim1 'abs (Lit 1))],}

@item{@racket[(not #t)] parses as @racket[(Prim1 'not (Lit #t))],}

@item{@racket[(cond [else 5])] parses as @racket[(Cond '() (Lit 5))],}

@item{@racket[(cond [(not #t) 3] [else 5])] parses as @racket[(Cond
(list (Clause (Prim1 'not (Lit #t)) (Lit 3))) (Lit 5))],}

@item{@racket[(cond [(not #t) 3] [7 4] [else 5])] parses as
@racket[(Cond (list (Clause (Prim1 'not (Lit #t)) (Lit 3)) (Clause
(Lit 7) (Lit 4))) (Lit 5))],}

@item{@racket[(case (add1 3) [else 2])] parses as @racket[(Case (Prim1
'add1 (Lit 3)) '() (Lit 2))].}

@item{@racket[(case 4 [(4) 1] [else 2])] parses as @racket[(Case (Lit
4) (list (Clause (list 4) (Lit 1))) (Lit 2))],}

@item{@racket[(case 4 [(4 5 6) 1] [else 2])] parses as @racket[(Case (Lit
4) (list (Clause (list 4 5 6) (Lit 1))) (Lit 2))], and}

@item{@racket[(case 4 [(4 5 6) 1] [(#t #f) 7] [else 2])] parses as @racket[(Case (Lit
4) (list (Clause (list 4 5 6) (Lit 1)) (Clause (list #t #f) (Lit 7))) (Lit 2))].}
]


@section[#:tag-prefix "a3-" #:style 'unnumbered]{Testing}

You can test your code in several ways:

@itemlist[

 @item{Using the command line @tt{raco test .} from
  the directory containing the repository to test everything.}

 @item{Using the command line @tt{raco test <file>} to
  test only @tt{<file>}.}
]

Note that only a small number of tests are given to you, so you should
write additional test cases.

@section[#:tag-prefix "a3-" #:style 'unnumbered]{Submitting}

To submit, use @tt{make} from within the @tt{dupe-plus} directory to
create a zip file containing your work and submit it to Gradescope.
