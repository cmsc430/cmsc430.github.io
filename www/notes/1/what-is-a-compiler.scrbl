@title[#:tag "Intro"]{What @emph{is} a Compiler?}


@section{Introduction}

Welcome to CMSC 430, An Introduction to Compilers.  Ostensibly this
class is about @emph{compilers}.  It's right there in the name.  And
yes, this course is very much about compilers, but really this course
is about the design and implementation of programming languages.
Compilers just happen to be one possible implementation strategy.

@section{What is a Programming Language?}

It is worth taking a moment and thinking about what exactly @emph{is}
a programming language?  At this point in your life, you've probably
used several different programming languages (we make you, after all).
You've written programs in C, Java, Rust, OCaml, and likely several
others.  You've maybe used these things without every really
reflecting on what they are.  So do that for a moment.

What did you come up with?

I start every semester by asking students to answer this question and
I get a variety of responses.  Here are a few:

A programming language:
@itemlist[
@item{"is an interface with the computer"}
@item{"is a human readable way to create computer instructions"}
@item{"is a combination of syntax and semantics for creating behavior"}
@item{"a formal language (a set of strings) that can describe any Turing machine"}
@item{"is a toolbox that prioritizes certain methods of solving problems"}
@item{"is a mechanism for communicating computational ideas with other people"}
]

Let's try to synthesize something coherent out of these different
perspectives.

Formally speaking, we can characterize a programming language by the
set of programs in that langauge.  For example, we might say the C
programming language is, at its core, the set of all possible C
programs that could be written.  This is the way one might
characterize a language in a theory of computation course.  If we
wanted to rigorously define this set, we could provide a formal
recognizer such as a finite automaton or even a Turing-machine that
given a string, determines membership in the set of programs.  This
aspect of a language we call its @bold{syntax}: it concerns the rules
governing the formation of phrases in the language.  While important,
syntax is not the end-all of a programming language, in fact it really
just the start of where the rubber meets the road.  For example, when
writing a C program we mostly don't care about whether the thing we
are writing is or is not in the set of C programs --- it being a C
program is a prerequisite to thing we want to do, which is to
@emph{compute}.  We write programs so that we run them.  Sure, you
might make a syntax error, forget to put a semicolon here or mispell
an identifier there, but the thing you really care about comes after
those issues have been resolved.  So another aspect of what a
programming language "is" concerns the @emph{meaning} of the sentences
in that language.  Every language has meaning.  In the context of
programming language, the meaning is a computation.  This aspect of a
langauge we its @bold{semantics}: it concerns the computational
content of programs in the language.

There are many ways we might define the meaning of a program, and
therby define the semantics of the language.  We could give examples,
e.g. "@tt{3 + 4} computes @tt{7}."  We could informally describe what
expressions of the langauge should compute, e.g. "`n + m` computes the
sum of @tt{n} and @tt{m}".  We could make more rigorous formal
definitions, appealing to mathematical notation and concepts.  We
could write a program (perhaps in a different language) that
@emph{interprets} expressions and computes their meaning.  Typically
some combination of all of these approaches are used.

But all of this @emph{defines} what a programming language is, which
is not the same as @emph{realizing} that definition.  For that we need
to implement the language, meaning we need to construct a universal
program that given any element of the language, it carries out the
computation defined by the meaning of that program.

Of course this is all a very formal view of what a programming
language is.  Arguably more important are other more human-centered
perspectives.  A programming language is a human-made language for
conveying computational ideas, both to machines and to other people.
Programming language design can enable (or prohibit) effective
expression of those ideas.

Programming languages have evolved over time from being very concerned
with low-level, machine-oriented details to higher-level abstractions,
freeing the programmer from those low-level details and often making
it easier to write better programs.  Language design can eliminate
whole classes of mistakes that might be possible in other languages.

@subsection{What is a Compiler?}

All that and no mention of compilers.  OK, so if we have a sense of
what a programming language is now, what is a compiler?  You've
probably used several before but maybe never reflected too deeply on
what exactly they were.  Take a moment and think about what being a
compiler means to you.

Compilers are a particular implementation strategy for realizing a
programming language.  At their heart, compilers employ a fundamental
technique of computer science for solving problems, they perform a
@emph{reduction}.  In order to compute the meaning of a program, a
compiler translates that program into a program in a different
language and then uses the realization of that language to compute the
answer to the original program.  This is in contrast to an
@emph{interpreter} which computes the meaning of a program directly.

There's something lurking here that may be causing you some
discomfort. Let's say you have a compiler that translates programs in
language A into programs in language B.  How does that help you run
your language A programs?  Well you just run your language B program
and what it computes will be the thing that the language A program
computes (assuming the compiler performed a correct translation).  But
you may be asking yourself, how do you compute the language B
program!?  It's not clear you're any closer to the thing you want.
Well, maybe you have a compiler from B to C.  And D to E.  Uh oh.  OK,
well maybe at some point you have an interpreter.  Let's say you have
an interpreter for langauge E.  After chaining all these compilers
together, you have a thing you can run directly by feeding it the E
interpreter and compute the result which is actually the result of the
original A program.  Pfew.

But wait... the program that interprets E programs, it has to be
written in a language. Let's say it was written in F.  How do we run F
programs?  Maybe we compile to G, H, I, K.  Maybe there's an intpreter
for K, written in L... Oh dear.  We still have this seemingly endless
regress because in order to compute programs in one langauge we have
to know how to compute programs in another language: that other
language is either the target language of some compiler or the
implementation language of some interpreter.  Where does this all
bottom out?

One concrete answer to this question is: it bottoms out at the machine
language of your computer and its CPU.  Eventually we hit a point
where there's a compiler that translates from some language into
machine code, or there's an interpreter that's written in machine code
(or we can compile the interpreter into machine code, etc.).  The
machine code is just another programming language, but it's a language
that has an intrepreter implemented in hardware.  It runs programs by
physically carrying out the computation of the program, thus providing
a foundation for building up our computational house of cards.
Ultimately, @emph{all} of the computations your computer is doing are
carried out at the level of machine code intepreted by the CPU.  So
even though you may be running Java, Python, or Rust code, what's
@emph{actually} happening is the CPU is running machine code.  But
here's the magical thing: it doesn't really matter.  Once you know
that you can run, say, Java code on your computer, you can view Java
as the foundation if you want.  If you wanted to develop a new
programming language, you could write a compiler that targets Java or
you could write an intepreter in Java.  Your new language could run
anywhere that Java can run (which is essentially anywhere).  One of
the great contributions of programming languages is that it allows us
to build the world we want to live in and leave the old one behind.
This is in fact @emph{why} compilers were invented in the first place.




An important observation to make: programming languages exist
independently of their implementations.  Java is not `javac`.  C is
not `gcc` (or `clang`).  Haskell is not `ghc`.  Compilers are a
particular implementation strategy for realizing a programming
language.  Sometimes languages get conflated with their
implementations.  And sometimes we go further and conflate properties
of the implementation with the language itself.  This leads to people
saying things like "Python is an interpreted language; C is a compiled
language."  Python is not an interpreted language, rather it's most
well-known implementation is an interpreter.  Compilers for Python
exist as do interpreters for C.

@subsection{What will be do in this course?}

We are going to study how to implementat a programming language by
making our own programming language.  In particular, we are going to
build a compiler for our language.

The language we are going to build is a modern, high-level
general-purpose programming language.  It will have features like:


@itemlist[
@item{built-in datatypes including integers, boolean, characters, strings, vectors, lists, and user-defined structures}
@item{first-class functions}
@item{pattern matching}
@item{memory safety}
@item{proper tail calls}
@item{automatic memory management}
@item{file I/O}
]

Our compiler is going to target x86-64 machine code, meaning that
programs written in our high-level language can be run on any system
capable of running x86-64 code, either natively in hardware, or
through software simulation (e.g. Rosette on Apple Silicon Macs).
x86-64 is one of the most ubiquitous instruction set architectures in
use today.  It's also quite large, complicated, and old, with some
design constraints that date back over 4 decades as it has evolved
from its 16-bit precursor first released in 1978.  The choice of
x86-64 as the target of our compiler is largely an arbitrary one.  We
could easily have picked another instruction set architecture, like
ARM64, or targeted an intermediate representation like LLVM IR.  In
choosing x86-64 we get a messy, "real", and bare-bones, low-level view
of computation and moving to any of these other similar settings would
be fairly easy to do.  Alternatively, we could have targeted a
higher-level language such as C or Rust, or even JavaScript or OCaml.
The more high-level the language, the easier it will be to serve as a
target for the compiler, especially when the target language's
semantics are close the source language's.  Doing so could certainly
be interesting, but it would illuminate compilation only down to the
level of abstractions of the target language.  By going all the way
down to machine code, we are able to understand the implementation of
our high-level language features completely down to the actions of the
CPU.  There will be no more mystery.

In order to side-step getting bogged down in making design choices, we
are going to implement (a subset of) an existing high-level langauge
called Racket.  Racket is a member of the Lisp family of langauges, a
descendent of the Scheme programming language, and a close cousin of
OCaml, which you've previously studied.  This is largely an arbitrary
choice.  We could have picked any programming language to build a
compiler for.  In choosing Racket, we get a mature, well-designed
language with a minimal, easy to parse semantics and a well-understood
and clear semantics that has features representative of many modern
high-level programming languages such as OCaml, Java, Python,
JavaScript, Haskell, etc.  If you can write a compiler for Racket, you
are well-equiped to write a compiler for any of those or similar
languages, or even to design your own new language.

We will us an incremental approach to study and build compilers,
meaning we will start by specifying and implementing a very small
subset of Racket.  Once specified, implemented, and tested, we will
enlarge the set of programs in the langauge, typically by adding some
new langauge feature.  Doing so necessitates revisiting the
specification and implementation to handle this extended set of
programs.  And then we rinse and repeat, growing the language from
something trivial into a fairly sophisticated language in which it's
possible to write interesting programs.  Each iteration of the
langauge will be a strict superset of the previous one, meaning that
all programs in the previous language will continue to be programs in
the next language.  The first iteration has nothing more that integer
literals and the final iteration contains a substantial subset of
Racket.

In this course, we pay particular attention to the concept of a
specification, which defines what it means for our compiler to be
correct.  We will use testing extensively to gain some evidence that
our compiler is not incorrect.  Our primary goal will be in writing a
correct, maintainable compiler for a full-featured language.  We will
not concern ourselves too much with concerns of efficiency or
optimization.  First things first: we have to build something that
works. After that, we can think about making it work faster.

We make extensive use of writing @emph{interpreters} as our form of
language specification.  Interpreters, when written as clear, concise
code in a high-level language, provide a precise distillation of the
semantics of a programming language.  They can also serve as a
reference implementation, used to validate other implementations of
the language.

@section{Beyond Compilers}

In my opinion programming langauges are fascinating objects, worthy of
study in their own right.  But there are reasons beyond compilers and
programming langauges for taking this class.

For any kind of craft it's worth reflecting on the tools one uses.
Doing so will make you better.  It may open you up to use new tools or
existing tools in new ways.  It may even allow you to design and
fabricate your own tools.  As computer scientists, our primary
expression of computational ideas comes in the form of writing
programs.  It's worth reflecting on the language in which we express
those ideas.

But part of what's valuable about a course like this really has little
to do with programming languages or compilers.  Compilers are
sophisticated artifacts.  They have complex invariants and subtle
specifications.  Getting them right is hard.  Learning how to program
to a specification, to think about invariants, to write clear, concise
and well-tested code is valuable beyond just writing compilers.





A function that maps an @emph{input} string to an @emph{output}
string.

@verbatim{
compiler : String -> String
}

Typically, the @emph{input} and @emph{output} strings are “programs”

@verbatim{
compiler : SourceProgram -> TargetProgram
}

For example, here are some well known compilers:

@verbatim{
gcc, clang : C          -> Binary          (* a.out, .exe *)
ghc        : Haskell    -> Binary
javac      : Java       -> JvmByteCode     (* .class *)
scalac     : Scala      -> JvmByteCode
ocamlc     : Ocaml      -> OcamlByteCode   (* .cmo *)
ocamlopt   : Ocaml      -> Binary
gwt        : Java       -> JavaScript      (* .js *)
v8         : JavaScript -> Binary
nasm       : x86        -> Binary
pdftex     : LaTeX      -> PDF
pandoc     : Markdown   -> PDF | Html | Doc
}

Key Requirements on output program:

@itemlist[#:style 'ordered
@item{Has the same @emph{meaning} (“semantics”) as input,}
@item{Is @emph{executable} in relevant @emph{context} (VM,
microprocessor, web browser).}

Compilers were invented to @link["http://worrydream.com/dbx/"]{avoid writing machine code by hand}.

From Binary to FORTRAN

Richard Hamming – The Art of Doing Science and Engineering, p25:

@para{@italic{In the beginning we programmed in absolute binary… Finally, a
Symbolic Assembly Program was devised – after more years than you are
apt to believe during which most programmers continued their heroic
absolute binary programming. At the time [the assembler] first
appeared I would guess about 1% of the older programmers were
interested in it – using [assembly] was “sissy stuff”, and a real
programmer would not stoop to wasting machine capacity to do the
assembly.}}

John A.N. Lee, Dept of Computer Science, Virginia Polytechnical Institute

@para{@italic{One of von Neumann’s students at Princeton recalled that
graduate students were being used to hand assemble programs into
binary for their early machine. This student took time out to build an
assembler, but when von Neumann found out about it he was very angry,
saying that it was a waste of a valuable scientific computing
instrument to use it to do clerical work.}}

flamewar just post this anywhere online where Haskell and OCaml folks
can see it.}

Racket has many advanced features beyond what you saw in 330, but we
